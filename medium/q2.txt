Q. Swastik is a clumsy fellow, and he tends to mess anything up
that comes to him, be it taking an important document somewhere, 
talking to a girl, or serving food!
When he gives drinks out to his guests, he can three cases.
1. He gives the equal amount to everyone. 
2. He gives the equal amount to everyone except two, one cup usually 
gets filled more, but the mean of the two amounts is exactly equal to
the amount in other hostels.
3. He messes up more than two glasses, after which it becomes hard to 
know the two glasses which got their drinks transferred. 

You are given n amount of integers, each integer representing the amount
of drinks in each glass. You are supposed to determine which of these 
3 cases would be holding true for the given input;

INPUT
n - The number of glasses;
followed by n integers, the amount in each glass;

OUTPUT:
Print "All good", if it is the first case,
"You shifted ${X} amount from glass #${g1} to glass #${g2}"
, and "You are dead" if it is the third;

where X is the amount transferred, g1 and g2 are the respective amounts in
each glass
