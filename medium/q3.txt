Q. Ayush loves strings! He is currently working with strings that only have
x and y as characters, and he defines the beauty of a string as the 
maximum length of the substring in the string that has equal characters;
Ayush has the ability to change at max k characters in the string from 
x to y, or vice-versa.
Ayush is not the best coder, sp he needs your help in figuring out
what is the beauty of a particular string that consists of only 
x and y as characters.
Can you help him figure out the beauty of each string?


INPUT:
n - length of the string;
k - max switches he can make
s - the string (only consists of x and y as characters)

OUTPUT:
The beauty of the respective string;
