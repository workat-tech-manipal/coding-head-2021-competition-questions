Swastik and Ayush challenged each other in a game of numbers; 
they both were required to think of a number and write it down in an array. 
Ayush was then instructed to have a combination of an array such that most numbers he thought of were greater than him at the ith position.
Your task is to find that combination to help him.
Explanation
Ayush = [20,70,110,150]
Swastik =[10,100,40,110]
output for Ayush =[20,110,70,150]
Ayush = [11,23,7,31]
Swastik = [12,24,31,10]
output for Ayush [23,31,7,11]

Input format 
T ---> no. of test cases
N ---> size of array
Followed by n elements of array for Ayush
Newline, followed by n elements of array for Swastik

Constraints 
1<=T<=100;
2<=N<=10000;
0<=elements of array<=10000
Output Format
