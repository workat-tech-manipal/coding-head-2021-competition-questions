Q. Aryamann is the biggest gambler that MIT had ever seen, he would
take the most stupid bets just to have fun and to earn some money.
His friend Arushi has the same nature, and this time they have gone crazy.
They take three random strings, a, b, c, and Aryamann has the task to 
remove some  characters from c (possibly 0), and insert it in any position in a,
so that the string b can be obtained. If b can be generated from removing 
characters from c and inserting anywhere in a, then Aryamann would win the bet, 
otherwise Arushi would win. Can you write the code to figure out
who would be the winner?

INPUT
t - number of test cases;
a - initial string;
b - target string;
c - the helper string;

OUTPUT
If b can be generated by shifting characters from c to a, then
print "Aryamann" without the quotes or print "Arushi" without the quotes.
