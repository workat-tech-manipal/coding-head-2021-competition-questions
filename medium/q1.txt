Q. Aryamann is the biggest gambler that MIT had ever seen, he would
take the most stupid bets just to have fun and to earn some money.
His friend Arushi has the same nature, and this time they have gone crazy.
Aryamann is good in math, but Arushi does not believe it. They have a bet, 
where a random integer is given to Aryamann, and if he can find two more
numbers such that the three numbers can form a pythagorean triplet, 
Aryamann wins the bet, otherwise Arushi wins the bet.
If a triplet cannot be formed, then Aryamann gives -1 as the answer.
Help Aryamann win!
