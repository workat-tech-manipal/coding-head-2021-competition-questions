Swastik loves adventure, and this time he is out on a voyage. He wants
to visit all the possible islands while he can, but he does not know
about the number of islands that there are. However, he has a rough map
that displays the part that has land and the part that has water. 
Can you help him determine the number of islands in the map?
NOTE:
    In the map, '1' would denote the part that has land, and '0'
    would denote the part that has water.

INPUT:
    n,m - the number of rows and cols;
    Followed by the respective values, only containing 
    '0' and '1'.
