During school days, Swastik was very interested in maths and always found it intriguing to make questions and solve them independently.
He came across an interesting problem statement; he defined a function f(n) = n and decided to find the number of groups possible such that their sum is equal to n.
For example
f(5) = 5; 7 combinations are possible which are
0+5
1+4
2+3
1+3+1
2+2+1
1+2+1+1
1+1+1+1+1
So you are tasked to find the total number of such combinations possible f(n) = n.
Input format 
T ---> number of test case
N ---> number required for function

Constraints 
1<=T<=100;
2<=N<=6*10^4
Output Format
Print the output corresponding to each test case on a new line.
